But before that I speak about them, I have one question to ask of you, Mr Nandy. Can you tell me why, in 3000 years of our history, people from all  over the world have come and invaded us, captured our land, conquered our minds? From Alexander onwards. The Greeks, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not invaded anyone. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because, I guess, we respected the freedom of others. Absolutely right. That is why my first vision is that of freedom. I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, when we started the war of independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build upon. If we are not free, no one will respect us. My second vision for India is development. For fifty years we have been a developing nation. It is time we saw ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top five nations of the world in terms of GDP. We have a 10 per cent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognised today. Yet we lack the self confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self reliant and self assured. Tell me, Sir, is this right? Read the last chapter of my book, India 2020, A Vision for the Next Millennium and you will get what I mean. I have a third vision. That India must stand up to the world. I have written 12 chapters on that. Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. In this world, fear has no place. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only  as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand in hand."}, "597": {"ques": "Though there are many TV programmes that are informative about India's development in various fields how can we make them more interesting so that they reach all strata of society?", "tag": ["many tv programmes", "various fields", "though", "strata", "society", "reach", "make", "interesting", "informative", "india", "development"], "ans": "Recently I went to a village called Keerapalayam.

Oil is already at $110 per barrel, and if this continues, this situation will be very tough to manage. So I set a goal of energy independence for my country. It\u2019s a three-dimensional approach. First, we should invest in solar power. Today solar power is not economical because the efficiency of solar cells is just 15% to 20%. So we should use CNT (carbon nano tubes) composites that can increase the efficiency of solar cells to 45% or 50%. Second, we should use nuclear energy, because India has abundant thorium based nuclear reactors. This is definitely a clean solution to energy needs.

Prof Vikram Sarabhai, heard about him? Well, my earliest inspiration was my science teacher, Sivasubramania Iyer. This man taught me in fifth class, I was 10 then. He was teaching how a bird flies. He went to the blackboard, drew the bird, its tail, nose, beak and wings and started talking about how it flies. You know which year [it was]? 1941. You were not even ideas then. After 45 minutes, he asked how many of us understood. Many students raised their hands. There were 30 of us who did not. He said, \"Those who did not understand...come in the evening.\" Rameshwaram is a small island, with birds flying over the sea. He said, \"Just watch, the wings are flapping. Now, the tail lifts, the wings flap and the direction changes.\" Tell me, what propels a bird? Cars and aircraft have engines, what does a bird have? Yes, life! Life is what actuates the brain. That's how he would explain. In a few minutes we all understood how a bird flies. But that's not important - what is important is, from that day something got into me, the bird's flight! I was just 10 but the teacher was so good he made me dream.... Flight? Science? I knew in a definite sense, my future had to have something to do with flight. That is how I developed interest in maths and physics. After school, I did aeronautical engineering at Madras Institute of Technology. Then on to rocket engineering at ISRO. That's where my career started. My science teacher put me on this orbit, but the full shape was given by Prof Sarabhai. He was a visionary. It was the '60s. Back then, we had no rocket, no missile, nothing. He gave us a vision statement\u2014India should design and develop high-powered rockets, make communication satellites, remote-sensing satellites.

We were in the Physical Research Laboratory also... I started my career in the VSSC and worked there for nearly 20 years - from 1962 to 1982. One of the major projects I was assigned then was to design, develop and build a satellite launch vehicle called SLV-3 to put the Rohini satellite into low earth orbit. This was India's first satellite. I had a fantastic team. It was called the SLV-3 team, and many technology groups at the VSSC, at the Sriharikota (SHAR) centre and the ISRO Satellite Centre (Bangalore) were all partners in this great mission. What we learnt when I put the satellite successfully into orbit in July 1980 was that in any task we do, the mission is greater than the individuals and organisations. That brought together many partners from research and development organisations, industries and various laboratories. This was one of the major experiences. This continued with me wherever I went. In 1982, when I joined the DRDO, one of the major programmes we evolved was the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. This programme, comprising many missiles, came out of the intensive partnership between the DRDO laboratories - the prime laboratory at that time was the DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation), and its Research Centre at Imarat, Hyderabad - and the defence industries, the armed forces and public and private sector industries. So, one is (the fact that the) mission (is) greater (than the individuals). Another is partnership. In both ISRO and the DRDO, when I was working there, thousands of engineers, scientists and staff (members) participated. Now the recent effort - a major mission that has been accomplished with the partnership of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), the DRDO and the Army - was the completion of five underground nuclear tests. I would attribute the success of this mission, as my friend Dr. R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, put it, to the \"synergy\" between the DAE and the DRDO. This has brought about a very important technological breakthrough. So the net result is the (joint) experience of three major scientific departments - ISRO, the DRDO and the DAE.

Now, Prof. Srinivasan gave us a six months project in our final year. The project was to design low-level (low altitude, he clarifies) attack fighter aircraft. So, having studied, aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, control, etc., here we have to put them together into a workable aircraft system design. I was the project leader for that. I was the ninth, so eight other people are there, someone would give propulsion, some other aerodynamics etc. So, after four and-a-half-months of study, I was there in my laboratory. The teacher, my guide comes. At that time we did not have computers, I was using the design board for drawing the design of the aircraft and my friends were all around me. So, he comes and sees and says, \u201cI\u2019m completely disappointed with your work; I am going to stop your scholarship if you don\u2019t complete the design in two weeks time.\u201d (Dr Kalam laughs.) It was a very costly education, if my scholarship stopped, I had to return home. I talked all kinds of things, gave him excuses, told him we had worked so hard, all of us are suffering etc. But to no avail. And so, finally all of us joined together day and night, Saturdays, Sundays; we didn\u2019t even go to our hostels. And we designed the fighter aircraft.On a Sunday evening Prof. Srinivasan came, exactly one day before the deadline. He saw the design, he was very happy. Then, he gave us Madras coffee in his house. (Dr. Kalam laughs again as he remembers). It taught me the value of planning, of teamwork, of time. But what we learned most out of that is that in the education system, while we study mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering etc. we should also have a clear understanding of how it all fits into a larger system, a productive system. So students must also be taught system design, system integration, system management, since that is what the industry wants.

I was given funds and human resources \u2014 but was told clearly that by 1980 we had to launch the satellite into space. Thousands of people worked together in scientific and technical teams towards that goal. By 1979 \u2014 I think the month was August \u2014 we thought we were ready. As the project director, I went to the control center for the launch. At four minutes before the satellite launch, the computer began to go through the checklist of items that needed to be checked. One minute later, the computer program put the launch on hold; the display showed that some control components were not in order. My experts \u2014 I had four or five of them with me \u2014 told me not to worry; they had done their calculations and there was enough reserve fuel. So I bypassed the computer, switched to manual mode, and launched the rocket. In the first stage, everything worked fine. In the second stage, a problem developed. Instead of the satellite going into orbit, the whole rocket system plunged into the Bay of Bengal. It was a big failure. That day, the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, Prof. Satish Dhawan, had called a press conference. The launch was at 7:00 am, and the press conference \u2014 where journalists from around the world were present \u2014 was at 7:45 am at ISRO\u2019s satellite launch range in Sriharikota [in Andhra Pradesh in southern India]. Prof. Dhawan, the leader of the organization, conducted the press conference himself. He took responsibility for the failure \u2014 he said that the team had worked very hard, but that it needed more technological support. He assured the media that in another year, the team would definitely succeed. Now, I was the project director, and it was my failure, but instead, he took responsibility for the failure as chairman of the organization. The next year, in July 1980, we tried again to launch the satellite \u2014 and this time we succeeded. The whole nation was jubilant. Again, there was a press conference. Prof. Dhawan called me aside and told me, \u201cYou conduct the press conference today.\u201d I learned a very important lesson that day. When failure occurred, the leader of the organization owned that failure. When success came, he gave it to his team.

In 1973, I was made the head of India's satellite launch program, also called SLV-3. Abdul Kalam Motivational Experience in Hindi www.officialkalam.com Our goal was to send our satellite 'Rohini' to space in any way until the 1980s. For which I was given a huge budget. And human resources were also provided. But I was also convinced that we have to fulfill this goal for a certain time. Thousands of people worked very hard Until 1979 - maybe August was the month - we thought we are now fully prepared. Being a project director on the launch day. I went to press the launch button in the control room. 4 minutes before launch, the computer started checking the list of things that were necessary. So that there is no shortage And then after some time the computer stopped the launch. He was telling that some things are not at the correct position as per the requirement. There were some experts as well as me. They assured me that everything is fine. And there are no mistakes. And then I bypass the instructions of the computer. And started the rocket. Everything was fine till the first stage. But the second stage got messed up. Instead of going into space rockets dropped into Bay of Bengal. It was a very big failure. On the same day, Chairman of Indian Space Research Organization (I.S.R.O.) Prof. Satish Dhawan called a press conference Prof. Dhawan, who was head of the institution. He took all responsibility for the mission's failure. And said that we needed some more technological measures. Media of the whole country was present there. He said that this work will be completed by next year. In the next year, July 1980, we tried again. And this time we have succeeded. The whole country was feeling proud. This press conference was also convened this time. Professor Dhawan called me in the side and said - \"This time you do press conference.\" On that day I learned a very important thing.

The World Energy Forum predicts that in five to eight decades, the fossil fuels will run out because these sources of energy are not renewable. Also, energy costs will go up. Oil is already at $110 per barrel, and if this continues, this situation will be very tough to manage. So I set a goal of energy independence for my country. It\u2019s a three-dimensional approach. First, we should invest in solar power. Today solar power is not economical because the efficiency of solar cells is just 15% to 20%. So we should use CNT (carbon nano tubes) composites that can increase the efficiency of solar cells to 45% or 50%. Second, we should use nuclear energy, because India has abundant thorium based nuclear reactors. This is definitely a clean solution to energy needs. The third focus area should be bio-fuels, including ethanol as well as bio diesel made from jatropha [a plant that grows in wastelands] and algae. These three initiatives can free India from dependence on fossil fuels.

I believe that connectivity is the key to bridging the rural-urban divide. The core-competence of the village will enable the production of competitive products for national and international markets.

In 1973 I became the project director of India\u2019s satellite launch vehicle program, commonly called the SLV-3. Our goal was to put India\u2019s \u201cRohini\u201d satellite into orbit by 1980. I was given funds and human resources \u2014 but was told clearly that by 1980 we had to launch the satellite into space. Thousands of people worked together in scientific and technical teams towards that goal. By 1979 \u2014 I think the month was August \u2014 we thought we were ready. As the project director, I went to the control center for the launch. At four minutes before the satellite launch, the computer began to go through the checklist of items that needed to be checked. One minute later, the computer program put the launch on hold; the display showed that some control components were not in order. My experts \u2014 I had four or five of them with me \u2014 told me not to worry; they had done their calculations and there was enough reserve fuel. So I bypassed the computer, switched to manual mode, and launched the rocket. In the first stage, everything worked fine. In the second stage, a problem developed. Instead of the satellite going into orbit, the whole rocket system plunged into the Bay of Bengal. It was a big failure.  That day, the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, Prof. Satish Dhawan, had called a press conference. The launch was at 7:00 am, and the press conference \u2014 where journalists from around the world were present \u2014 was at 7:45 am at ISRO\u2019s satellite launch range in Sriharikota [in Andhra Pradesh in southern India]. Prof. Dhawan, the leader of the organization, conducted the press conference himself. He took responsibility for the failure \u2014 he said that the team had worked very hard, but that it needed more technological support. He assured the media that in another year, the team would definitely succeed. Now, I was the project director, and it was my failure, but instead, he took responsibility for the failure as chairman of the organization. The next year, in July 1980, we tried again to launch the satellite \u2014 and this time we succeeded. The whole nation was jubilant. Again, there was a press conference. Prof. Dhawan called me aside and told me, \u201cYou conduct the press conference today.\u201d I learned a very important lesson that day. When failure occurred, the leader of the organization owned that failure. When success came, he gave it to his team. The best management lesson I have learned did not come to me from reading a book; it came from that experience. Continuing further with the six traits, the fourth trait is that the leader should have the courage to make decisions. Fifth, the leader should have nobility in management. Every action of the leader should be transparent. And finally, the leader should work with integrity and succeed with integrity. All the traits apply especially to the President of a country. The President continuously must be in touch with the people. The Rashtrapati Bhavan [i.e., the presidential residence in New Delhi, India's equivalent of the White House] must become the people\u2019s residence.
